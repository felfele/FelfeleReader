## Communication

### Task management

We aim to document all our work on GitHub. The processing of a new issue is the following:
1. new issue is submitted, _unscheduled_ label added automatically
2. labels and comments can be added
3. prioritization happens every monday, when issues is prioritized, the _unscheduled_ label is removed
4. issue is normally closed when a PR resolves it and is merged to master

### How to contact us

Our [slack](https://join.slack.com/t/felfele/shared_invite/zt-clseo486-L~kgODYDt1HKPUfmlAuxrA) channel is open to everyone interested in the project. Here you can ask questions, and also follow the latest discussions including product, design, and development. You can always reach out to us at hello@felfele.org.

## Development

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,
email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.

### Reporting Bugs

Found a bug in the app? Here are some notes on how to report it so we
can fix it as fast as possible:

- Explain, as detailed as possible, how to reproduce the issue
- Include what you expected to happen, as well as what actually happened
- please include on what specific device, OS version, and application version have you experienced the issue
- If it helps, feel free to [attach a
  screenshot](https://github.com/blog/1347-issue-attachments) or video
  illustrating the issue
- If you're having trouble with a specific post or other kind of content, please include a link to it if it's possible
- Include all this information in a new issue on our [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/felfele/feeds/issues)

### Pull Request Process

Know how to fix something? We love pull requests! Here's a quick guide:

1. [Check for open issues](https://github.com/felfele/feeds/issues), or
   open a fresh issue to start a discussion around a feature idea or a bug
   Opening a separate issue to discuss the change is less important for smaller
   changes, as the discussion can be done in the pull request
2. Fork the repository on GitHub, and start making your changes
3. Push the change (we recommend using a separate branch for your feature)
4. Open a pull request
5. We try to merge and deploy changes as soon as possible, or at least leave
   some feedback, but if you haven't heard back from us after a couple of days,
   feel free to leave a comment on the pull request
