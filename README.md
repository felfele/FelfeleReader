- You can also follow Reddit subs, Youtube channels, Tumblr and Mastodon
- No signup or registration, everything happens and stays on your phone
- Export and import feeds between your devices or with your friends
- No algorithmic timeline: what you see is what you follow
- Mute content with keywords
- Explore new content with the built-in category browser

The project is developed by a core team funded by a non-profit organization and volunteers from all over the world.
